Create schemas (FOSUserBundle) :

	php bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test

Create and activate user :

	php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --env=test

Copy Phpunit config :

  cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml

Launch tests using :

  bin/phpunit

Authentication system
---------------------

The Authentication system is based on the JWT token as implemented by [Lexik](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle)

User management is done through [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle), you can easily add / edit / delete users by using their API.

The server provides a Rest API using [FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle) allowing you to connect using the following query: 

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/api/login_check -d '{"username":"bob","password":"Abc123"}'`

Client Side specifics
---------------------

On the client side, I've inspired my code from Angular official documentation about HttpInterceptor, allowing me to send the JWT Token on each HTTP request when token is available.

The token is sent in *Authorization* headers: 

`Authorization: Bearer xxx`

You should also change the preconfigured keys for signatures by generating your own keys using :

  openssl genpkey -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
  openssl pkey -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem -pubout

And copy the passphrase into the field `JWT_PASSPHRASE` in `.env` file.

You should also update the `APP_SECRET` in `.env` file.

You can use this template and adapt it to your needs.
